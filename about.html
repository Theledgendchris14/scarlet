            <h1>How i got inspired</h1>
            <p> I was inspired by my brother at a young age around the age of 7.</p>
            <p>I started drawing and faced many mistakes and believed that i would never get better at drawing.</p>
            <p>Around two years i started to watch youtube videos from Misiqarts and White manga</p>
            <p>Now i have my own style of art and i would someday like to pursue it someday in my life time</p>
